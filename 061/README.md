You are given a list of names, and you are asked to write a code
that returns all the names that start with ‘S’. Your code should
return a dictionary of all the names that start with S and how
many times they appear in the dictionary. Here is a list below:
names = ["Joseph","Nathan", "Sasha", "Kelly", "Muhammad",
"Jabulani", "Sera”, "Patel", "Sera"]
Your code should return: {"Sasha": 1, "Sera": 2}
