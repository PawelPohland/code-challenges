Write a function called word_index that takes one argument, a list of strings
and returns the index of the longest word in the list. If there is no longest
word (if all the strings are of the same length), the function should return
zero (0).

For example, the list below should return 2.

words1 = ["Hate", "remorse", "vengeance"]

And this list below, shoul return zero (0)

words2 = ["Love", "Hate"]
