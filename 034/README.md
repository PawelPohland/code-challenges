Implement a function that takes a list of numbers (0 included as even)
and returns sum of all odd numbers as a first number and sum of all
even numbers as a second number

s_odd_even([2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9]) ➞[Odd sum,Even sum]➞ [19, 16]
Odd sum= 3 + 7 + 9 = 19 and Even sum=2 + 6 + 8 = 16

s_odd_even([-3, -4, -8, -5, -2, -6]) ➞ [-8, -20])
