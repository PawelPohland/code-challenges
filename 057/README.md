You work for a school and your boss wants to know how many
female and male students are enrolled in the school. The school
has saved the students in a list. Your task is to write a code that
will count how many males and females are in the list.

Here is a list below:

students = ['Male', 'Female', 'female', 'male', 'male', 'male',
'female', 'male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'female']

Your code should return a list of tuples.
The list above should return:

[(‘Male’,7), (‘female’,6)]
