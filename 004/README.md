Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from
console and generates a list and a tuple which contains every number.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

34,67,55,33,12,98

Then, the output should be:

List: ['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
Tuple: ('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')
