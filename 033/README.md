Write a Python program that checks if the string s contains all the letters in the alphabet
(case-insensitive, so "A" should be equivalent to "a").

If it does, print True otherwise - print False.

If the string contains spaces, ignore them before finding the result.
You may assume that the string doesn't contain any other symbols, only spaces (possibly).

Consider these letters as part of the alphabet: 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
